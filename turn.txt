1) Set up the current turn (playTurn method)
	- deploy 1 action to playerTurnActions
	- deploy 1 buy to playerTurnBuys
	- ensure playerTurnCoins is 0
	- check length of playerDeck to ensure it is > 0
		- if playerDeck length is 0, shuffle playerDiscard into playerDeck (this should be its own method)
	- check for any duration effects before entering the Action phase
		- apply duration effects and adjust their iterations
	- check for cards in the setAside pile that should be placed into this hand
	- enter the Action phase

2) Set up and perform the actionPhase (actionPhase method)
	- loop through the action phase until:
		- playerTurnActions == 0
		- player chooses to leave Action phase
			- pass turn
			- plays a treasure
	- when player plays a card, check for reactions from other players prior to initiating the card
		- play through each players reaction in order from the next player whose turn it is
	- if a player discards any cards during the action phase, check for reactions to the discard
	- any card that is set aside goes into the setAside list for the next turn
	- iterate loops of action phase to keep track of how many actions have been performed, and how many cards have been played
	- any time a card is pulled from the deck, check the deck to ensure it doesnt need to have the discard pile shuffled into it (this should be a function called in any cardDraw method)
	- when action phase ending criteria have been met, enter the buy phase

3) Set up and perform the buyPhase (buyPhase method)
	- allow player to place appropriate treasure cards into playArea.
		- iterate playerTurnCoins for each coin value played
	- only allow players to buy cards equal to or less than the value of coins in their playerTurnCoins
	- after each card is purchased, check for player reactions
	- when playerTurnBuys == 0, or player chooses to exit Buy phase, enter cleanUpPhase

4) Set up and perform the cleanUpPhase 
	- move all cards from playArea on top of the discard pile (append to end of playerDiscard)
	- move all cards from playerHand on top of the discard pile
	- leave cards in the setAside pile for the next turn
	- exit cleanUpPhase and pass playTurn on to next player
